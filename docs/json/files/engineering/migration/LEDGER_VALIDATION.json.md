## Interpretation and provenance

- Source of truth: the original JSON file at the path above. This generated reference never changes original data.
- This is an OBSERVED FIELD INVENTORY, not a formal JSON Schema or proof every nested record has identical keys.
- Original units, code edition, specimen/ETABS source, record ID, solver version and experimental status must be checked within the source file or linked manifest.
- A value without documented units/source must be classified UNVERIFIED, not automatically assumed kN-m-s.
- For historical outputs do not use to populate current run configuration or calibrated material parameters.
- Material/source specimens are not project-approved RC bar schedules or manufacturer-qualified dampers.
- External data may be private. This script runs offline and does not upload file contents.

## Validation requirements

- Confirm valid UTF-8 JSON and expected field/type/units against the producing program.
- Verify hashes, compare input and output manifests, and preserve experiment/case identity.
- For nonlinear runs check G00–G10 acceptance gates and explicit failure/incomplete statuses.
