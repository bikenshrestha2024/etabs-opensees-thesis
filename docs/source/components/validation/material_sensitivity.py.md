# material_sensitivity.py — source documentation

**Python source:** [components/validation/material_sensitivity.py](../../../../components/validation/material_sensitivity.py)
**Git baseline content SHA:** c658169572b9e153727a7a67f8c5e4c7ae3d214e
**Subsystem:** Code criteria, benchmark comparison and experimental evidence
**Priority:** P1 — verify with unit/integration tests

## Responsibilities and contracts
Part of the validation implementation subsystem. Check the exact classes/functions, argument names, return structures and imported callers in the linked source before altering its interface. This guide documents engineering verification obligations, not an already-completed API test.

## Source, inputs, units
Document original ETABS export path/SHA, declared kN-m-s model units, stress conversion, local axes, accepted coordinate/section mapping and any third-party scientific input. Do not substitute nominal reinforcement, material grade or a literature benchmark for tested project data.

## Outputs and failure conditions
Capture source commit SHA, model/ground-motion fingerprint, ULS/SLS, record orientation, completed physical duration, solver diagnostics, exception traceback and linked reports. Mark failed or truncated runs and do not include them in thesis rankings.

## Research and standards
Relevant register IDs: R01 R04 R05 R10 R12 R13. Consult [research reference register](../../../00_RESEARCH_REFERENCES.md). These identify potentially applicable publications, not proof of parameter calibration or test reproduction.

## Regression acceptance
Review source syntax and imports, create a focused unit test, then run an isolated OpenSeesPy component or ETABS-comparison benchmark where applicable. For full-building NLTHA require all [thesis acceptance gates](../../../00_THESIS_ACCEPTANCE_GATES.md).
